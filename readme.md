# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Unity. The current version of the game supports two human players. The game allows players to take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for future updates:

1. **Computer Player**: Implement an AI-driven computer player to play against human players. This will provide an option for single-player gameplay.
2. **Grid Size Scaling**: Add a user interface (UI) component to allow players to scale the grid size. This will provide flexibility to play Tic Tac Toe on grids larger than 3x3, introducing an additional challenge.(code for scaling grid size already implemented)
3. **Online Peer-to-Peer Support**: Introduce online multiplayer functionality to enable players to compete against each other remotely. This will involve implementing a peer-to-peer networking solution to facilitate game sessions over the internet.
4. **Improved UI and Main Menu**: Enhance the user interface and add a main menu to provide a more polished and intuitive experience for players.
